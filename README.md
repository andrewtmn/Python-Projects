## Python Projects

### Project 1:
#### Alarm app
 - simple alarm app based on real time
 
  TODO: 
  - format the frames and widgets to look aesthetic
  
  IMPROVEMENTS: 
  - deal with datetime format instead of just minutes

### Project 2:
 #### Expense Tracker
 - simple expense tracker, logging spendings for several categories of spending 
 - displays a line graph of total monthly spendings over a one year period
 - displays a bar graph of categorical spendings for the current month
 - displays a pie chart for categorical spendings for the current month
 
  TODO:
  - align the entry widgets to make them look pretty 
  - add category names to the x-axis of the bar chart instead of numbers
  - pie chart legend overlaps the actual piechart

  IMPROVEMENTS:
  - instead of having an 'update graph' button, we could somehow allow the 
    'Log Spendings' button to communicate with the other classes so that when
    the monthly expenditure is updated, the graphs are automatically update
  - could use better looking images to represent the buttons
